# 🚀 Deployment Instructions - IMPORTANT!

## Your chatbot is now fixed for all devices!

I've converted your chatbot backend to use **Netlify Functions** (serverless), which means it will work on any device - your Mac, phone, or anyone else accessing your website.

---

## 📋 What Changed:

1. ✅ Created a Netlify Function for the chatbot backend (`netlify/functions/chat.js`)
2. ✅ Updated `chatbot.js` to use the Netlify Function instead of localhost
3. ✅ Created `netlify.toml` configuration file
4. ✅ Added `package.json` for dependencies
5. ✅ Updated `.gitignore` for Netlify

## 🔑 STEP 1: Set Up Your API Key in Netlify (REQUIRED!)

Before deploying, you **MUST** add your Anthropic API key to Netlify:

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com) and log in
2. Click on your **vishnuanapalli** site
3. Go to **Site settings** > **Environment variables** (in the left sidebar)
4. Click **Add a variable**
5. Add:
   - **Key**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `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`
6. Click **Save**

## 🌐 STEP 2: Deploy to Netlify

### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com) and find your site
2. Go to the **Deploys** tab
3. Drag your **entire portfolio-website folder** onto the deploy area
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for it to build and deploy

### Option 2: Git/GitHub (Recommended for future updates)

If you want automatic deployments whenever you make changes:

1. I can help you set this up later - just ask!

## ✅ STEP 3: Test Your Chatbot

After deployment (2-3 minutes):

1. Go to https://vishnuanapalli.netlify.app/
2. Click "Ask Vishnu"
3. Type: "what major are you"
4. You should get a response about Information Technology Systems!

---

## 🎉 What This Fixes:

- ✅ **Before**: Chatbot only worked on your Mac (localhost)
- ✅ **After**: Chatbot works on ANY device - phones, tablets, other computers!

---

## 📱 Testing on Your Phone:

After you deploy:
1. Open https://vishnuanapalli.netlify.app/ on your phone
2. The chatbot should now work perfectly!

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting:

**If chatbot doesn't work after deployment:**
1. Check that you added the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable in Netlify
2. Make sure the API key is exactly as shown above (no extra spaces)
3. Wait 2-3 minutes after deploying for the function to activate
4. Try clearing your browser cache or opening in incognito mode

---

## 💡 Cost:

- Netlify Functions: **FREE** (up to 125,000 requests/month)
- Your Anthropic API usage will be charged based on usage
- Estimate: ~$0.25 per 1000 chatbot messages with Claude Haiku

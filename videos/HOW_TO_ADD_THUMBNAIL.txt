How to Add Video Thumbnail (Screenshot from your video)
========================================================

OPTION 1: Use VLC Media Player (Recommended - Free & Easy)
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Open your video (about-me.mp4) in VLC Media Player
2. Pause the video at the beginning showing your face
3. Go to Video menu → Take Snapshot
4. VLC will save the screenshot to your Pictures folder
5. Rename the screenshot to "video-thumbnail.jpg"
6. Move it to the images/ folder
7. Done! The video will now show your face as the thumbnail

OPTION 2: Use QuickTime (Mac)
------------------------------
1. Open about-me.mp4 in QuickTime Player
2. Pause at the frame showing your face
3. Press Command + Shift + 4 (screenshot tool)
4. Take a screenshot of the video frame
5. Save as "video-thumbnail.jpg" in the images/ folder

OPTION 3: Use Photos/Preview app (Mac)
---------------------------------------
1. Import your video to Photos app
2. Find the frame with your face
3. Export that frame as an image
4. Save as "video-thumbnail.jpg" in the images/ folder

The HTML is already set to use "images/profile.jpg" as the thumbnail,
so you can either:
- Use your profile photo (already set up), or
- Take a screenshot from the video and replace profile.jpg

Current setup: The video uses your profile.jpg as the poster image,
which looks professional and consistent with your profile photo above!
